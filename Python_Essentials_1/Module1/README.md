Cisco PCAP - Programming Essentials in Python

## Module 1

A program written in a high-level programming language is called a source code
Python was created by Guido van Rossum, born in 1956 in Haarlem, the Netherlands.

Why not Python?
Despite Python's growing popularity, there are still some niches where Python is absent, or is rarely seen:

low-level programming (sometimes called "close to metal" programming): if you want to implement an extremely effective driver or graphical engine, you wouldn't use Python;
applications for mobile devices: although this territory is still waiting to be conquered by Python, it will most likely happen someday.

### Installing Python

IDLE is an acronym: Integrated Development and Learning Environment.

Write & Run code pressing F5 when the editor window is active.
This is for learning purpose IDLE.

### Components of an IDE

- an **editor** which will support you in writing the code (it should have some special features, not available in simple tools); this dedicated editor will give you more than the standard OS equipment;
- a **console** in which you can launch your newly written code and stop it forcibly when it gets out of control;
- a tool named a **debugger**, able to launch your code step-by-step, which will allow you to inspect it at each moment of execution.
