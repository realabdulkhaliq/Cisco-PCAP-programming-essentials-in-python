# Take a look at the code in the editor: it reads a float value, puts it into a variable named x, 
# and prints the value of a variable named y. Your task is to complete the code in order to 
# evaluate the following expression:

x =  0.0
x = float(x)
y = 3 * x ** 3 - 2 *x ** 2 + 3 * x - 1

print("y =", y)
x =  1
x = float(x)
y = 3 * x ** 3 - 2 *x ** 2 + 3 * x - 1
print("y =", y)
