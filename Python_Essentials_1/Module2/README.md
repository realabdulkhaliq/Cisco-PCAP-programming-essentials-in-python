## A Function

A function is able to:

**cause some effect** (e.g., send text to the terminal, create a file, draw an image, play a sound, etc.)

**evaluate a value** (e.g., the square root of a value or the length of a given text) and return it as the function's result

a function may have:

- an effect;
- a result.

`function_name(argument)`

print()

takes its arguments (it may accept more than one argument and may also accept less than one argument)

What value does the print() function return?

None.

argument is implicitly used in the following way: end="\n".

## Literals - the data in itself

**A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself.**

123 is a literal, and c is not.

You would write the number like this: 11,111,111, or like this: 11.111.111, or even like this: 11 111 111.

Python doesn't accept things like these. It's prohibited. What Python does allow, though, is the use of underscores in numeric literals.

11_111_111
