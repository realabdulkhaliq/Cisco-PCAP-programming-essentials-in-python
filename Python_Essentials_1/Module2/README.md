## A Function

A function is able to:

**cause some effect** (e.g., send text to the terminal, create a file, draw an image, play a sound, etc.)

**evaluate a value** (e.g., the square root of a value or the length of a given text) and return it as the function's result

a function may have:

- an effect;
- a result.

`function_name(argument)`

print()

takes its arguments (it may accept more than one argument and may also accept less than one argument)

What value does the print() function return?

None.

argument is implicitly used in the following way: end="\n".

## Literals - the data in itself

**A literal is data whose values are determined by the literal itself.**

123 is a literal, and c is not.

You would write the number like this: 11,111,111, or like this: 11.111.111, or even like this: 11 111 111.

Python doesn't accept things like these. It's prohibited. What Python does allow, though, is the use of underscores in numeric literals.

11_111_111

### Variables

how to store the results of these operations, in order to use them in other operations
special "boxes" (or "containers" as we may call them) for that purpose,
and these boxes are called variables ‒ the name itself suggests that the content
of these containers can be varied in (almost) any way.

`variables (an identifier) = "boxes" (containers)`

- a name
- a value

* the name of the variable must be composed of upper-case or lower-case letters, digits, and the character \_ - (underscore)
* the name of the variable must begin with a letter;
* the underscore character is a letter;
* upper- and lower-case letters are treated as different
* the name of the variable must not be any of Python's reserved words (the keywords)

### Keywords

['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lambda', 'nonlocal', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'return', 'try', 'while', 'with', 'yield']

They are called keywords or (more precisely) reserved keywords. They are reserved because you mustn't use them as names: neither for your variables, nor functions, nor any other named entities you want to create.

**A variable comes into existence as a result of assigning a value to it.**
