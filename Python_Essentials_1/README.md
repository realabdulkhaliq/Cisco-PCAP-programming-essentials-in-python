Why not Python?
Despite Python's growing popularity, there are still some niches where Python is absent, or is rarely seen:

low-level programming (sometimes called "close to metal" programming): if you want to implement an extremely effective driver or graphical engine, you wouldn't use Python;
applications for mobile devices: although this territory is still waiting to be conquered by Python, it will most likely happen someday.
